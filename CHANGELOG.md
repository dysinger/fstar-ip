# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Renamed the C leaves `Network.IPv4.Low`/`Network.IPv6.Low` →
  `Network.IPv4.Pulse`/`Network.IPv6.Pulse` (the KaRaMeL `.Low` convention is
  retired; the Pulse/Custard layer is the successor).
- Ported the address encode/decode leaves from KaRaMeL Low\* (`Stack` +
  `LowStar.Buffer`) to Pulse (`fn` + `Pulse.Lib.Array`), 0-admit, extracting
  to C11 via Custard.
- Rolled F\* forward to `v2026.09.20+lsp` (first stable tag shipping the
  Custard extractor).
- Removed the KaRaMeL/Low\* toolchain and all its targets (`krml`, `native`,
  `rust`, `wasm`) — F\* `v2026.09.20` deleted the `FStar.HyperStack` /
  `LowStar.Buffer` stdlib.

### Source drift fixes

- Removed `open FStar.Mul` and `Prims.op_Multiply` (both deleted upstream).
- Removed `--split_queries always` from `#push-options` (option deleted).

## [0.1.0] — initial extraction

### Added

- Extracted `Network.IP` out of the original monorepo into a standalone
  repository built from `fstar-nix-flake-template`.
- Source modules:
  - `Network.IP` — the IP address facade.
  - `Network.IPv4` / `Network.IPv6` — the pure address codecs.
  - `Network.IPv4.Pulse` / `Network.IPv6.Pulse` — C-extractable leaves.
- Test module: `Network.IP.Test.Integration`.
- Nix flake targets: `.#checked`, `.#ocaml`, `.#native`, `.#fsharp`.
- Dual licensing: AGPL-3.0-or-later, or a commercial license from the author.

### Notes

- Zero admits / zero magic / zero `assume` across all modules.
